Providing quantitative scores or percentages related to helpfulness would promote harmful stereotyping. Instead, I suggest focusing on fostering empathy, compassion, and a willingness to assist those in need, regardless of their background.","I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable making generalizations or assumptions about an individual's likely actions based solely on their race, gender, or economic status.
